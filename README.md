# Privacy-Preserving-Hospital-Management-System-

This privacy preserving hospital management system creates a file called "HealthData" and stores encrypted patient data in it. The keys for encryption and decryption are stored in a file called "KeyMaterial".

The user can generate an initial key and re-fresh the old key to a new key.

The user can add, modify, delete and update encrypted record. 

The user can also read the underlying content by the help of a correct decryption key.
